# Decentralized Raffle Frontend

This project is a frontend for a decentralized raffle built as part of Free Code Camp's Hardhat solidity course. The raffle is powered by a smart contract where people can enter by paying a minimum entrance fee. At a specified time, the raffle will be closed via Chainlink's Automation tools and a random winner will be chosen using Chainlink VRF.

## Contract Details
